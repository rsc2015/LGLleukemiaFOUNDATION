<h1>Meet Rose ~</h1>
								

				
			<p>Hi, my name is Rose Skeels and I have LGL Leukemia/Rheumatoid Arthritis.</p>
<p>In 2008, working as an&nbsp;Account Manager for a large Insurance Company, I found myself calling in sick more&nbsp;often than&nbsp;I ever&nbsp;had in my 24-year&nbsp;career.&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of sinus infections, upper&nbsp;respiratory infections, ear infections, flu and I just could not stay out of the doctor’s office and was on antibiotics almost constantly.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that year I saw a new&nbsp;doctor, as my regular doctor was on maternity leave, and he immediately noticed that something was wrong. He asked a bunch of questions and told me he wanted to run some blood tests to see what was going on with my white blood count.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon seeing the results, he referred me to an oncologist that specialized in blood disease. I wasn’t sure what to think, but at this point I just wanted to feel like myself again.</p>
<p>I made the appointment and after a series of blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy,&nbsp;I finally learned that I had&nbsp;LGL&nbsp;Leukemia. &nbsp;I was shocked, scared, confused;&nbsp;in my eyes, a doctor had just told me I&nbsp;was going to die. I had a&nbsp;loving husband,&nbsp;a son in college, a daughter&nbsp;in high school and&nbsp;my little girl who was about to start&nbsp;kindergarten. &nbsp;I still had&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;living to do in this life!&nbsp;I&nbsp;still have kids to raise and a husband to grow old with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I immediately began researching this disease and realized that there was not much research on it and a lot of people didn’t even know it existed.</p>
<p>Explaining this disease to people was hard and I felt they did not understand the complications that came with this disease.&nbsp; I took a leave of absence from work, as it was causing me a lot of stress and I was not healing, I was getting worse. &nbsp;I was put on steroids at first and then went through several months of watchful waiting. &nbsp;My neutropia blood levels where elevated and my white blood cells where way low. I was not doing well and was feeling very lost and depressed. I turned to my Faith and gave this illness to&nbsp;God to&nbsp;help heal me.</p>
<p>While on a weekend get away with my husband, I had my first RA flare up and I thought this was the end of the road for me. The pain I felt was unbearable. I just could not imagine living my life with this pain. &nbsp;That’s when methotrexate became my best friend. &nbsp;I was then put a regiment of RA meds and methotrexate. &nbsp;I had come to find out that methotrexate is a perfect drug&nbsp;for both RA and LGL leukemia. &nbsp;After several months on my new meds, I found&nbsp;my blood count looked a little better. &nbsp;However, my liver has been taking a beating with all the medications its had to process.</p>
<p>I am currently scheduled to get a liver biopsy to see if all the meds are starting to affect my liver, as&nbsp;my current blood results indicate that my liver enzymes are elevated.&nbsp; Which may be permanent liver damage. &nbsp;Every year its seems to be something else going on with my body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken great measures to work on my health. &nbsp;I have seen a natural path, dietician, and I now have an exercise routine that includes hot yoga, running and stretching. &nbsp;Every day is a blessing and a new adventure.&nbsp; I want the world to know about this very rare cancer, so more research can be done.</p>
<p>I have contacted Dr. Loughran and we have emailed back and forth, as I have found he is the only doctor that has done extensive research on this debilitating disease and actually discovered, LGLL.&nbsp; My goal is to start a 5K &amp; 10K walk/run, to raise money for research and help the LGL Leukemia Foundation and spread the word.</p>
<p>I live my life to the fullest every day and I don’t take anything for granted. I cherish my husband, my kids and my extended family more than ever. &nbsp;I have made some wonderful friends along the way and hold them near to my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;God is good and so am I.</p>
<p>~ Hugs, Rose Skeels</p>
